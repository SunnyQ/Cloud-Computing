1. In addition to source code I also included jar files I used on EMR for steps 1 & 2.

2. To avoid the version conflict issue on EMR after testing on my MAC, I created jars with required binaries.

3. Both jars/programs need two arguments: InputDirectory OutputDirectory

4. As per Step 3 recommendation in handout, used Hive for querying required data. Also included Hive queries in separate file along with source code for steps 1 & 2.
